# stracket

A Clojure library designed to make using JaCoP easier.

JaCoP is a constraint programming solver. 
See http://jacop.osolpro.com/ and https://github.com/radsz/jacop for more info.


From ArchFriends.java in the JaCoP examples.

> Harriet, upon returning from the mall, is happily describing her
> four shoe purchases to her friend Aurora. Aurora just loves the four
> different kinds of shoes that Harriet bought (ecru espadrilles,
> fuchsia flats, purple pumps, and suede sandals), but Harriet can't
> recall at which different store (Foot Farm, Heels in a Handcart, The
> Shoe Palace, or Tootsies) she got each pair. Can you help these two
> figure out the order in which Harriet bought each pair of shoes, and
> where she bought each?
